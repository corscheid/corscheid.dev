        Hi, I&apos;m Corey and I&apos;m a Full Stack Web Developer in the Saint
        Louis, Missouri area.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning new technologies as well as building and collaborating
        on open source projects. Much of my knowledge set pertaining to software
        development has risen from my insatiable drive to learn and tinker with
        modern technologies and frameworks outside of my university studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the development I have done thus far has been for the{' '}
        <a href="https://LearnNavi.org/">LearnNa&apos;vi</a> Community using the
        alias &ldquo;Tirea Aean&rdquo; (Na&apos;vi for{' '}
        <em>&lsquo;Blue Spirit&rsquo;</em>) or &ldquo;tirea&rdquo; (
        <em>spirit</em>). Learning and teaching the Na&apos;vi language from
        James Cameron&apos;s AVATAR has been a fun hobby for me since January
        2010. It was also how I found my way towards choosing to become a
        Software Engineer as my career goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my favorite technologies to work with these days are{' '}
        <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> /{' '}
        <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://developer.android.com/">Android</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>, and{' '}
