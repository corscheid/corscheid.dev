# corscheid.dev

This is the source code for my website, [corscheid.dev](https://corscheid.dev).

It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/).

Every time I push to the `main` branch of this repository, the website is automatically deployed to production on Vercel, thanks to GitHub integration.

Blog Posts are parsed from Markdown files on disk and GitHub project entries are fetched from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). The site performance is still blazing fast despite that and being built with TypeScript React, because of the magic that is Next.js Static Site Generation.
